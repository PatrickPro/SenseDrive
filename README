Sense-Drive:

We used an Arduino Mega 2560 board connected to our custom-made servo and motor driver board.
Control commands can be issued via serial console (9600baud & newline).

Following commands are implemented:
FL   = Vibrate Front Left
FR   = Vibrate Front Right
ML   = Vibrate Middle Left 
MR   = Vibrate Middle Right
RL   = Vibrate Rear Left        
RR   = Vibrate Rear Right
ALL  = Vibrate  All 
TEST = System Test
SN   = Shift Neutral
SF   = Shift Forward    
SR   = Shift Reverse


PINOUT:
PIN 46: Front Servo
PIN 44: Rear Servo
PIN  2: Vibration Front Left
PIN  3: Vibration Front Right
PIN  4: Vibration Middle Left
PIN  5: Vibration Middle Right
PIN  6: Vibration Rear Left
PIN  7: Vibration Rear Right
